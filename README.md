# BornomalaApp
 A simple kids' bengali alphabet learning app using Flutter

#Please read this before you download 
 
  This app is made using Flutter framework. I tried to make this application in a way so that a person who never tried programming he or she can make this 
  application after seeing the video tutorial. I need to mention you one thing. It is always wise to learn by watching the tutorial and the source code is 
  actually you can just have an idea of the overall project. 
  
  In the source code the fundamentals and key things are so appropriate and well structured. But you will find a problem which is if you try to copy and paste
  this source code while playing some letter's video you will see nothing is playing and a black window is appearing. It is because I may be made a mistake while 
  writing the asset file's name properly. This is actually not a mistake as our intention is only Learn Flutter and how to make this very simple application. 
  
  If you can import one asset file and can successfully able to run a video, the rest of the things are the same.
